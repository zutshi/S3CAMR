We have presented another methodology to find falsifications in black
box dynamical systems. Combining the ideas from abstraction based
search (\chapref{abs}), with our previous relational
abstractions~\cite{zutshi2012timed}, we created enriched abstractions.
These can be checked for safety violations using existing bounded
model checkers.  We used learning techniques to estimate the local
dynamics underlying trajectory segments, and approximated a transition
system from a black box system. Finally, we showed our approach on a
few examples.

As a future extension, we are working on a specialized BMC for the
problem at hand. We intend to explore efficient ways for encoding the
PWA relational system.

%  There are several directions we can take from here.

%  \paragraph{Impr}The biggest impediment to our approach are SMT solvers which use the
%  theory of reals with exact precision. This is important for
%  verification approaches, but not can be relaxed for falsification. An
%  SMT solver which uses approximate reasoning but returns robust
%  counter-examples will be very useful, though it doesn't exist as yet.

%  \subsection{Challenges and Extensions}
%  Let us outline the challenges we face in this approach. Although
%  SAT/SMT solvers are very efficient owing to extensive engineering
%  effort, reachability of transition systems resulting from dynamical
%  systems remains a difficult problem.
%  
%  %Why exactly?
%  As the time horizon of the safety property increases, the possible
%  combinations of discrete transitions increases exponentially. Hence,
%  to find a counterexample which is a sequence of discrete transitions
%  over a `long' time horizon is not tractable for most but the simplest
%  of dynamical systems. % Solve using proper discretizations
