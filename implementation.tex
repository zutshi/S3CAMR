\section{Implementation and Evaluation}

The implementation was prototyped as S3CAM-R, an extension to our
previously mentioned tool S3CAM (\chapref{case}). OLS regression
routines were used from Scikit-learn~\cite{pedregosa2011scikit},
Python module for machine learning. SAL~\cite{SAL-SRI}
with Yices2~\cite{dutertre2014yices} was the model checker.

We tabulate our preliminary evaluation in \tabref{res-rel}. We use the
Van der Pol oscillator and the Brusselator, as described in the previous
chapter. As before, we ran S3CAM-R $10$ times with different seeds and
averaged the results. We tabulate both the total time taken and the
time taken by SAL to compute the counter-example and compare against
S3CAM.

\caption{Avg. timings for benchmarks. The \textbf{BMC} column lists time
    taken by the BMC engine. The total time is noted under
\textbf{S3CAM-R} and \textbf{S3CAM}.}

The results are favorable and show promise. However, we need to
explore more benchmarks to conclude conclusively.
