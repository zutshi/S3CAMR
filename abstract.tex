In this work we address the problem of findfing behaviors violating a
given time bounded LTL property in hybrid dynamical systems. We
approach the problem in two distinct steps. First, we approximate the
behavior of the underlying system using a piecewise affine discrete
time model. The model is incomplete in nature and is computed with
respect to the given property.  We then encode the falsification
search as a bounded model checking query and use an SMT solver to find
a counter example. If found, we check the violation to ensure
reproducibility in the given hybrid dynamical system.
